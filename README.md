# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

A future feature to be implemented on this website will be the addition of another form where users can order takout food, instead of booking a table. This form will have the user choose what they want for pick-up, and the form will show them upfront the cost of their order.
